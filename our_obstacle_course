# for me, purva and harshas obstacle course we made a rough terrain, it is made with cardboard and hot glue, to test if the basebot can manage to make it over the rough terrain. 
#then we made a ramp, which is made with wood blocks and wood glue to test the indurance of the basebot
#then we made a twisty pathway out of cardboard to see if the basebot could stay on the path
#then we made flowers to make an obstacle which is made from the 3d printer
# then we made a rail way so the flowers can be pushed into something
